### TCGA Pathology Reports in Machine Readable Text


## Code and associated data for "Benchmark Pathology Report Text Corpus with Cancer Type Classification" (Kefeli et al.).  

Reports can be found above, in TCGA_Reports.csv.zip.

Due to large file size, imgs_for_aws (images for Textract input) and aws_response (response files for Textract output) can be found at the following repository: https://tatonettilab.org/resources/tcga-path-reports/
